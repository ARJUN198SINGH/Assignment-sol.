    "\n",
    "ANS:-The curse of dimensionality basically refers to the difficulties a machine learning algorithm faces when working with data in the higher dimensions, that did not exist in the lower dimensions. This happens because when you add dimensions (features), the minimum data requirements also increase rapidly.As the dimensionality increases, the number of data points required for good performance of any machine learning algorithm increases exponentially. The reason is that, we would need more number of data points for any given combination of features, for any machine learning model to be valid."
