    "\n",
    "1.Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to develop a system that predicts the LC50 (Lethal Concentration 50) value of a chemical compound using machine learning techniques. The system should take as input the structural properties of the compound and provide an estimate of its toxicity level.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.System Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed system can be designed as a web-based application. The architecture consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. User Interface: A user-friendly web interface to allow users to input the structural properties of the compound and receive the predicted LC50 value.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Feature Extraction: This component extracts relevant features from the compound's structural properties. These features capture the important characteristics that influence the compound's toxicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Machine Learning Model Training: The training component uses a dataset of known compounds with their corresponding LC50 values to train a machine learning model. The model learns the patterns and relationships between the compound features and the toxicity levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Prediction Engine: The prediction engine utilizes the trained machine learning model and the extracted features of the compound to generate the predicted LC50 value. This component applies the learned patterns and relationships to make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. Database: A database to store compound features, training data, and the trained machine learning model for model management, retrieval, and update purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "The system follows the following workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. User inputs the structural properties of the compound through the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. The Feature Extraction component processes the input and generates relevant features for the compound.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. The Machine Learning Model Training component uses a dataset of known compounds and their LC50 values to train a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. The trained machine learning model is stored in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. The Prediction Engine applies the trained machine learning model and the compound features to generate the predicted LC50 value.\n",
    "\n",
    "f. The predicted LC50 value is displayed to the user through the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Security and Performance Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "User authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented to ensure the system's security.\n",
    "The system should handle concurrent user requests efficiently by using scalable and optimized algorithms.\n",
    "The database should be designed for fast retrieval and storage of compound features, training data, and machine learning models.\n",
    "Data encryption techniques should be employed to protect sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Integration and Extension:\n",
    "\n",
    "The system can be integrated with external databases or APIs to retrieve additional compound information or toxicological data for enhanced prediction accuracy. It can also be extended to incorporate more advanced machine learning algorithms or ensemble models to improve prediction performance.\n",
